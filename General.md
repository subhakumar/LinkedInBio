As a software engineer at First Tech Federal Credit Union, I build responsive and highly scalable web applications that enhance the digital banking experience for over 600,000 members. I use web frameworks such as React.js, Node.js, and Express.js, as well as web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JavaScript, PHP, and RESTful web services. 

I have over 5 years of experience in front-end development, having previously worked for ROOMDEX and Age of Learning, Inc. At Age of Learning, I developed front-end features for leading kids education platforms ABCmouse and Adventure Academy, leveraging the company's internal JS framework for configurable UI. I also led the definition and implementation of accessibility and internationalization standards, and implemented assets lazy loading to maximize web performance and limit HTTP requests. I wrote and tested functional and visual test cases using automation testing platforms such as Applitools and Sauce Labs.

I hold a master's degree in computer engineering from California State University, Northridge, where I gained proficiency in programming languages such as Python and C++, and databases such as MySQL. I also have multiple certifications in computer networking, digital network security, and creative HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems. I am interested in full-time software engineer roles, with a focus on front-end development.
